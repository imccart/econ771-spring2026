Module 1 covers health insurance markets.

We then study adverse selection as a central friction in insurance markets, before turning to insurer competition and market structure. The module concludes with public insurance design, emphasizing how government programs interact with private markets and how policy design affects incentives, enrollment, and efficiency.
