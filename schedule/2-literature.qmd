title: "Healthcare Variation and Physician Agency"
---

In this module, we study how physicians make treatment decisions in environments characterized by asymmetric information, discretion, and multiple, sometimes conflicting objectives. We begin by introducing physician agency as a central organizing framework for understanding medical decision-making, and then examine how both financial and non-financial incentives shape physician behavior. We conclude by moving beyond the individual physician to consider how treatment decisions are influenced by organizational structure and team-based care, highlighting how agency operates within groups, hospitals, and integrated delivery systems. Here's a long list of papers that I think are particularly relevant in this area.
