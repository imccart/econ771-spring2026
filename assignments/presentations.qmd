title: "Presentations"

Please review the [class schedule](../schedule/) and select four papers from the list of topics in each class. Once you've identified your papers, note your selection and date on the **Presentations** tab of our shared Google Sheet (available on Canvas). Please note your selections no later than **January 16**, and please ensure no more than one student is signed up to present on any given day. 

Your presentation should be around 60 minutes, following a standard seminar setup. Please also prepare two discussion questions to lead a 10-15 minute discussion after your presentation. Please submit your presentations via **Canvas** prior to your in-class time.

Your presentation should be no more than 50 slides (including a title slide and your discussion questions at the end). Each presentation is worth 5 points toward your final grade, with one point allocated to each of the following categories:

- **Presentation length:** You must stick to the 60 minute presentation length (including questions but not including the final discussion)
- **Slide layout:** slides should be clear and concise, with minimal text
- **Presentation clarity:** the presentation should be clear and well-organized, with a clear description of the research question, data, empirical analysis, and results
- **Figures and Tables:** your presentation must have at least 5 figures.
- **Discussion questions:** the discussion questions should be clear and thought-provoking. Please conclude your presentation with a final slide listing these questions.

Note that a presentation is not just a re-hashing of the paper in slide form. A good academic presentation should have as little text as possible on each slide, and the content on the slides doesn't necessarily need to follow that of the paper. For example, in a real-time environment, it is much easier to move between different aspects of the empirical analysis and data. Below are lists of candidate papers for presentation for each module. These are also listed in the shared spreadsheet (on Canvas) from which you can formally indicate your selections.

In addition to these 4 graded presentations, I expect everyone to present and discuss recent job market papers toward the end of the semester (Module 6). While ungraded, these JMP presentations will help everyone better understand the quality and rigor of recent top job market papers in our field.
