Below are basic descriptions of each category of assignments for this semester. More details are available on the individual pages for each assignment. 

## Research Proposals
You'll submit three proposals thoughout the semester. Each proposal should consist of four parts, explained in more detail [here](/assignments/research-proposals), and is worth 10 points toward your final grade. The written proposal should be 2 pages, double-spaced, 12-point font, and 1-inch margins.

Think of the research proposal as a more informed version of brainstorming. This should be something for which you've given some serious thought but where you haven't yet started any analysis. You at least have some idea of the data you'd like to use, where to find it, and how to use it (i.e., you have some identification strategy and estimation method in mind). The purpose of the proposal is to develop and idea sufficiently far before receiving feedback. 

## Research Plans
Your research plan consists of five parts, explained in more detail [here](/assignments/research-plans). This is an extension of the research proposal where you consider the value-added of your work relative to the existing literature. Essentially, the research plan is your research proposal plus a literature review. You should take your best research proposal, based on feedback from me (and possibly your peers and classmates), and develop a slightly longer three-page report (double-spaced, 12-point font, 1-inch margins). 

The research plan is worth 10 points toward your final grade (2 points per section of the report). It is due via **Canvas** by **April 21**. You will also need to develop a short 15 minute presentation for your proposal. We'll spend the final two class days discussing your research plans and how best to turn them into papers!

## Paper Presentations
You will present four academic papers throughout the course of the semester. The list of potential papers for any given day is on the [class schedule](../schedule/), with additional details [here](/assignments/presentations). Please note your selected papers and class dates on the **Presentations** tab of our shared Google Sheet (link availabel on Canvas) no later than **January 20**. Each presentation is worth 5 points toward your final grade.

## Empirical Exercises
There are four prepared empirical exercises. Three of the excercises focus on central causal inference strategies (difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, or regression discontinuity), and the fourth exercise considers the analysis of competition in healthcare, including demand estimation. You must select one exercise to complete throughout the semester no later than **January 29**, and note your selection on the **Exercises** tab of our shared Google Sheet. No more than two students per exercise. 

Each exercise requires a good amount of your time outside of class to get the data in working order and implement the relevant identification strategy and econometric estimator. Raw data for each exercise will be provided on our class OneDrive folder, the link to which is on Canvas, or via the paper's online replication package. For more details on each exercise and on the requirements for submission, see [here](/assignments/empirical-exercises).

## "Excellence" Blueprint
The objective of this assignment is to move beyond critiquing flaws and instead develop an appreciation for very high quality academic writing and research execution. You will analyze a recently published, high-impact health economics paper, dissecting not only its substantive contribution and rigor but also the writing, narrative, and presentation that secured its placement in a top-tier journal. Your final blueprint should be no longer than 4 pages and is due on **March 17**.

Your analysis must answer the core question: What specific choices, in both research design and articulation, warrant this paper's strong publication and reputation? In answering this question, please divide your report into two sections:

1. **The Science:** Address the paper's substance and fit within the literature. This section should detail what the paper contributes and how its methods stand up to scrutiny.

    - *Novelty and Contribution:* Clearly articulate the paper's central research question. What specific gap in the literature does it fill? What is the single most important new insight this work provides to the field of health economics?
    - *Methodological Excellence:* Analyze the core empirical strategy. What choices (e.g., data selection, identification strategy, or estimator) demonstrate methodological rigor? Why is the chosen method appropriate in this case?
    - *Engagement with Literature:* Assess how the authors position their work. Identify two key papers the authors successfully build upon or challenge, and explain how the introduction and discussion sections integrate the new findings into the existing scholarly conversation.

2. **The Art:** Analyze the paper's execution and its persuasive power. This section should detail how the authors guide the reader and present their findings clearly.

    - *Introduction and Hook:* Dissect the first two pages. How does the paper successfully motivate the question and establish its importance to both academics and policymakers? Pinpoint two specific sentences or paragraphs that are highly effective in hooking the reader and explain why they work.
    - *Clarity and Structure:* Evaluate the overall narrative flow. How do the authors simplify and present complex econometric analyses? Identify specific structural elements (e.g., headings, figures, tables) that enhance clarity and guide the reader through the evidence without sacrificing technical precision.
    - *The Policy Takeaway:* Analyze the conclusion and/or discussion sections. How do the authors move from specific empirical findings to a broader, impactful policy implication? Explain how the discussion ensures the paper's findings are memorable and actionable.
